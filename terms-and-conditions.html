            We represent and warrant that (i) the Services (including all software and technology related thereto)
            and the provision thereof do not and will not infringe or violate any third-party rights, including
            intellectual property rights, proprietary rights, contract rights, trade secrets or any other third party
            right and (ii) we shall take all necessary and industry-standard precautions to ensure the security of

          <h3 class="h3">8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>

          <p>
            To the maximum extent permissible by applicable law, in no event shall either party be liable to the other
            for any indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages of any form, including
            but not limited to lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, or computer failure, for any matter
            arising out of or in connection with your use of our services and/or this agreement, whether such liability
            is asserted on the basis of contract, tort or otherwise, even if a party has been advised of the possibility
            of such damages. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential
            or incidental damages, so the above limitation may not apply. Each party's liability to the other party and
            its affiliates for all claims arising out of this agreement, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, will
            not exceed the amount paid by you for any of our services during the twelve (12) months prior to
            when the liability arises. The foregoing limitations shall not apply to indemnification obligations
            or claims arising from a partyâ€™s gross negligence, willful misconduct or intentional breach.
          </p>

          <h3 class="h3">9. INDEMNIFICATION</h3>

          <p>
            Except to the extent caused by the other party's actions, each party agrees to indemnify the other party
            for all claims, losses and expenses, including legal fees, that directly arise as a result of the indemnifying
            party's material breach of this Agreement.
          </p>

            We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices
            of any third-party websites or services. You further acknowledge and agree that we shall not be responsible or liable,
